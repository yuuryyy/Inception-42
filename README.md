## Project Overview
This project focuses on system administration and infrastructure setup using Docker. The core goal is to virtualize a multi-service web environment, specifically a LEMP stack (Linux, Engine X/Nginx, MariaDB, PHP-FPM) to host a WordPress site. It's a deep dive into container orchestration, networking, data persistence, and foundational security.

## Learning Objectives
  * > Master Docker & Docker Compose: Understand containerization, image creation with Dockerfile (using Debian as the base OS), and multi-container application management with docker-compose.
*I'll fill this section with my personal objectives as I progress through the project.*
